Nascido na cidade de São Paulo, sou\n                técnico em mecatrônica pelo Colégio São Judas Tadeu, formado em\n                bacharelado em física pela Universidade de Sâo Paulo, onde fiz\n                iniciação científica na área de física médica com estudos em\n                ressonância magnética.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Fiz mestrado em estatística e computação pelo ICMC-USP, casado\n                desde 2015 com minha maravilhosa esposa Priscila, trabalho desde\n                2010 no Itaú e, atuei nos últimos cinco anos com projetos de\n                desenvolvimento de sistemas.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Desde 2018, tenho como hobby a impressão 3D, depois de comprar\n                minha primeira impressora, o primeiro modelo da Stella (Boa\n                Impressão 3D), quando dediquei muito estudo para aprender a\n                manusear os softwares e calibrar a impressora até conseguir\n                imprimir os objetos com qualidade. Também aprendi a desenvolver\n                programas para placas de prototipação, como o Arduino, para\n                integrar sistemas eletrônicos às peças produzidas na impressora\n                e criar dispositivos inteligentes conectados à internet\n                (internet das coisas).\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Foi quando comecei a pesquisar o uso dessas tecnologias na área\n                da saúde. Vi o potencial que a impressão 3D tem para o\n                desenvolvimento dessa área após encontrar diversos grupos que\n                atuam com produção de próteses, órteses e de recursos de\n                tecnologia assistiva, conversar com professores e profissionais\n                da área, visitar feiras como a Reatec. e descobri o quanto\n                carecemos de tecnologia sendo desenvolvida nacionalmente com\n                esse foco.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Durante o ano de 2020, com a pandemia do Covid-19, ingressei no\n                Projeto Hígia, para a produção de protetores faciais (face\n                shields) utilizando impressão 3d para doação a hospitais e\n                profissionais da saúde da rede pública, como forma de diminuir a\n                probabilidade de infecção com o Coronavírus.
